## Help with website translations

If you're comfortable with code, please follow the instructions below. If you're not comfortable with code but still want to help, reach out to us in the #translation channel of the OWA [Discord](https://discord.gg/x53hkqrRKx).

### Adding a new language

#### 1. Translate the global content

Global content is located in two files:
- `_data/languages_base.json`
- `_data/navigation.json`

In `_data/languages_base.json`, add the new language to the `supported` array, using the  the [ISO language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes).

Duplicate the english object with the new languages translations. 

The new language object in the data files must include all properties on the `en` object.

The url of navigation links should remain in english.

#### 2. Populate all the pages and posts

From the root project directory, run `npm run generate`. 

This script will:
- create a new folder with the new language code
- create a copy of each page located in `src/pages`
- create a copy of each post located in `src/post`
- create a copy of the tag page in `src/robots-meta`
- update the copied files permalinks to prepend the new language code
- add `translated: false` to the page's front matter

#### 3. Translate pages

Translate the copied version of the homepage and any additional pages you are translating.

Remove the `translated: false` property from the front matter of pages you have translated. This will remove the "not yet translated" banner from the page.

#### 4. Add language autodetection for homepage

Update `netlify.toml` to include a redirect on the homepage to auto detect the user's language based on browser preference

### Translating pages for existing language

Each language has a folder corresponding with its [ISO language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes). 

Files in this folder that are currently in English can be translated directly. 

Once the page is translated, (including the front matter title and meta description), please remove the `translated: false` property. This will remove the "not yet translated" banner from the page.

### Guidelines

A few questions you may have when translating:

- "Open Web Advocacy" should be treated as a proper noun and remain in English.
- Hashtags and social media platform names should be treated as proper nouns and remain in English.
- If the translated language has a formal and informal option, err on the side of direct and informal. For example in Spanish, this would be using the term "t√∫" instead of "usted".
