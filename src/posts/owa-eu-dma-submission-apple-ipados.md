As the EU further rolls out the Digital Marketing Act, they have designated a variety of companies and their platforms as “Gatekeepers”. You can see the [complete list of Gatekeepers](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_4328) and some really useful explainers on what being a [Gatekeeper means on the EU’s very informative website](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en).

Now that Gatekeepers have been designated, the companies that operate those services have had the opportunity to rebut their designations. 

A particularly interesting response was from Apple, who have made the case that iPadOS is a separate operating system entirely from iOS, both of which are currently designated as platforms subject to the DMA, along with the Apple AppStore. Their arguments essentially boil down to usage statistics for iPadOS alone being below the required usage numbers to fall under the rules and should not be designated a Gatekeeper platform service.

The [EU consequently opened an investigation into the merits of this claim](https://ec.europa.eu/competition/digital_markets_act/cases/202343/DMA_100047_5136.pdf), and as such, OWA had the opportunity to respond as to why we believe that iPadOS should not have the Gatekeeper designation removed for this platform, and should not be considered separate from iOS in general.  

In broad strokes, OWA argued that:



* Apple’s argument about the size of the EU iPad market is in dispute. [IDC](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=IDC_P36344), for example, shows the iPad market in Europe (the UK inclusive) to be nearly 45MM devices, far above Apple’s claimed active monthly user base. At minimum, Apple needs to show its work. 

* The distinction between iOS and iPadOS is only skin deep.  
 
For most of the history of the iPad, iOS was it’s Operating System, and the launch schedules and differences in feature sets have not substantially diverged [since the 2019 marketing change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS#History). 

* The cross-device impacts of Apple’s wealthier customer base influence technology choices and investments far in excess of the install base. Discounting the network effects of the iOS/iPadOS App Store-based logic of software development and distribution is to focus on the trees, rather than the forest. 

* The DMA’s framing explicitly rejects the sorts of surface arguments and attempts at artificial subdivision that Apple has put forward here. A failure to recognise the anticompetitive architecture of Apple’s influence over app stores, and the interlocking ways they do so across the Apple ecosystem, would be a failure of the implementers of the DMA to correctly interpret the spirit of the law. 
 
Apple gates proprietary API access on iOS in exactly the same ways, and through the same terms and conditions, with the same anti-competitive restraints on browser and applications choice, on iOS as it does on the lately-rebranded iPadOS. This is a sizable entrypoint to wealthy consumers across the EU, which amplifies the effects of the restrictions.
