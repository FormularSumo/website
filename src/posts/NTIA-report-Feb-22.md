[Bruce](https://brucelawson.co.uk) published an [article](https://brucelawson.co.uk/2023/the-ntia-report-on-mobile-app-ecosystems/) where he gives us a summary of the NTIA (National Telecommunications and Information Administration) report on Mobile App Competition.

> The question now is whether Apple will do the right thing, or seek to hurl lawyers with procedural arguments at it instead, as theyâ€™re doing in the UK now.

> But for every month they delay, they earn a fortune; itâ€™s estimated that Google pays Apple $20 Billion to be the default search engine in Safari, and the App Store earned Apple $72.3 Billion in 2020.

## Note

Apple's AppStore revenue is ~ $72.3b, but they receive approximately 30% of that.

The $20 Billion from Google for search engine placement in Safari is likely almost all profit.
That's 11% of Apple's yearly profit for doing nothing except banning their competitors from iOSðŸ¤¯

**Browser Ban = Higher Market Share for Safari = Google Search Engine Revenue**
