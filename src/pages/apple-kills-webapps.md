# Apple has officially announced that they’re killing web apps in the EU

## ACT NOW

We need immediate support from web developers and businesses that operate online in the EU.  The European Commission needs to hear from YOU to understand the devastating impact Apple’s new ban will have on your livelihoods, businesses and customers.

To facilitate this, please complete our quick form so that we can understand the scale of the impact and provide it to the EU.

If you are not in the EU, or you’ve already sent us your information, please share this message far and wide. We need information immediately to have an effect on this outlandish change from Apple, designed to crush the web entirely.

## What’s happening?

Apple have announced a series of changes designed to comply with the European Union’s Digital Markets Act. 

Throughout this process, they’ve chosen to maliciously comply as much as possible, resulting in a series of decision meant to cripple the ability for anyone to compete on their platform.

You can read more about the changes they’ve made in these two blog posts:
