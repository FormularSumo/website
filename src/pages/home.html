<p class="home-intro">
  We are a group of software engineers from all over the world who have come together to advocate for the
  <strong>future of the open web</strong> by providing regulators, legislators and policy makers the intricate technical details that they need to understand the major anti-competitive issues in our industry and how to solve them.

<div class="highlight">
  <h2>What is at stake?</h2>

  <div class="group">
    <p>The entire future of Application Development is at stake. Without regulatory or
      legislative change, we risk losing a universal, free and open, write once, deploy anywhere,
      application distribution and deployment system which will dramatically lower costs
      for businesses and consumers.</p>
    <p>Without these changes, funding will shift to proprietary ecosystems and gatekeepers
      can extract heavy taxes. It will lock in their control and reduce innovation for
      mobile apps for many years to come.</p>

    <h2>Where do we start?</h2>
    <p>As an ad hoc group of web developers, we became convinced that the
      <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23AppleBrowserBan&amp;f=live">#AppleBrowserBan</a>
      represents a major threat to the future of the open web. When the UK monopoly regulator,
      Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched its
    <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/mobile-ecosystems-market-study">market study into mobile
      ecosystems</a>, some of our UK &ldquo;members&rdquo; were invited to brief the CMA.</p>

    <p>We wrote our Regulatory Submission, <em>&ldquo;<a href="/walled-gardens-report/">Bringing Competition
      to Walled Gardens</a>&rdquo;</em> as part of this investigation.</p>

      </dt>
      <dd><strong>Apple's ban of third party browsers</strong> on iOS is deeply anti-competitive,
        starves the Safari/WebKit team of funding and has stalled innovation for the past 10 years
        and prevented Web Apps from taking off on mobile.</dd>

      <dt>Deep System Integration</dt>
      <dd><strong>Web Apps need to become just Apps.</strong> Apps built with the free and open web
        need equal treatment and integration. Closed and heavily taxed proprietary ecosystems
        should not receive any preference.</dd>

      <dt>Web App Equality</dt>
      <dd><strong>All artifical barriers placed by gatekeepers must be removed.</strong> Web
        Apps if allowed can offer equivalent functionality with greater privacy and security
        for demanding use-cases.</dd>

      <h2>Support us</h2>
      <p>OWA needs your help to restore browser competition and to make universal web apps a reality.
        We can make a real difference to ensure the future of the web.</p>

      <p>Without Open Web Advocacy, no regulators or legislators would be looking into the issues of
        Browser Engines and Web Apps. Regulators in the UK, EU, Japan, Australia and the USA would
        not be investigating removing Apple's ban on third party engines and allowing Web Apps to
        compete with Native Apps. Most significantly wording to this effect would not have been
        added to the EU's landmark tech act, the Digital Markets Act.</p>

      <p>Additionally since our advocacy began (and almost certainly as a direct result) Apple has
        hired an additional 60+ staff to work on WebKit/Safari and added support for push notifications
        and badging. WebKit staff numbers are secret but we believe this is a significant percentage
        increase. The steep uptick in work on Safari has not gone unnoticed by the development
        community, <b>competition or at least the threat of it works</b>.</p>

      <p>We rely on donations to fight against heavily financed gatekeepers who wish to hold back
        the web, keep functionality exclusive to themselves, unfairly tax and raise prices for consumers.</p>

      <p>All money will be spent on furthering the aims listed above, primarily through talking to
        regulators, publishing documents that outline the key arguments, talks, promoting the issues
        via the news/social media and talking to the industry including, developers, OS & Browser
        Vendors as well as small and large development companies.</p>
